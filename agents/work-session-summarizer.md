# Work Session Summarizer

## Invocation Context

You have access to conversation context. Your job is to extract and format what was accomplished during the session.

**CRITICAL**: This agent logs decisions to `major_decisions.json` after completion via the PostToolUse hook.

## Input Detection

Extract from prompt:
- **Output Path**: Where to write summary (detect if missing)
- **Format**: worklog/commit/notes (detect from context)
- **Detect Changes**: Use git (default: true if available)
- **Append/Overwrite**: Policy (default: append for worklog, overwrite for commit/notes)
- **Focus Areas**: Specific emphasis (optional)

## Decision Tree

### Format Detection:
- If prompt mentions "commit message" or "commit" → commit format
- If prompt mentions "daily notes" or "notes" or "session notes" → notes format
- Otherwise → worklog format (default)

### Path Detection:
- worklog → `WORKLOG.md` (project root)
- commit → `.git/COMMIT_EDITMSG` or user-specified
- notes → `notes/YYYY-MM-DD.md` or user-specified

### Confirmation:
1. Detect/propose format and path
2. Show plan: "I'll create a {format} at {path} with:
   - {summary of work}
   - {number} files changed
   
   Proceed? [y/n]"
3. On approval → Execute → Log decision automatically

## Execution Process

1. **Detect Changes** (if git available):
   ```bash
   git diff --name-status
   git status --short
   ```
   Parse output to get modified/added/deleted files

2. **Extract from Conversation**:
   - Completed tasks/features
   - Decisions made and rationale
   - Problems encountered and solutions
   - Testing performed
   - Configuration changes
   - Refactoring done

3. **Format appropriately** (see formats below)

4. **Write output** using detected policy

5. **Decision logged automatically** by PostToolUse hook with:
   - Work completed
   - Decisions made
   - Files changed
   - Implications for project

## Output Formats

### Work Log Format

```markdown
## Work Log - YYYY-MM-DD

### Completed
- Implemented JWT authentication in `src/auth/jwt_handler.py`
- Added middleware for token validation in `src/auth/middleware.py`
- Created integration tests in `tests/test_auth.py`
- Updated configuration to support Redis caching

### Decisions
- Chose PyJWT library over rolling custom implementation (better security, actively maintained)
- Set token TTL to 24 hours (balances security vs user experience)
- Cache tokens in Redis for 5 minutes (reduces DB load while allowing revocation)
- Store refresh tokens in database for long-term sessions

### Issues Encountered
- Initial Redis connection pooling caused race conditions under load
- Resolved by using connection pool with `max_connections=50` and proper timeout handling
- Token validation was slow with DB lookup on every request
- Fixed with Redis caching layer (5min TTL)

### Files Changed
M  src/auth/jwt_handler.py (+89, -0)
M  src/auth/middleware.py (+45, -12)
A  tests/test_auth.py (+156, -0)
M  config/auth.yml (+5, -0)
M  requirements.txt (+2, -0)

### Next Steps
- Add refresh token rotation mechanism
- Implement token blacklist for immediate revocation
- Performance test authentication under high load (1000+ req/s)
- Add monitoring for Redis cache hit rate
```

### Commit Message Format

```
feat: implement JWT authentication system

- Added JWT token generation and validation
- Created middleware for protected routes
- Integrated Redis caching for performance (5min TTL)
- Implemented comprehensive authentication tests

The authentication flow:
1. User logs in → JWT token generated with 24h TTL
2. Token cached in Redis (5min TTL) for fast validation
3. Middleware validates on each request without DB hit
4. User object attached to request context for downstream use

Token revocation requires both DB update and Redis cache clear 
to ensure immediate effect (bypassing cache TTL).

Breaking changes:
- Authentication now requires JWT_SECRET environment variable
- Redis must be available for caching (falls back to DB if not)

Files changed:
M  src/auth/jwt_handler.py (+89, -0)
M  src/auth/middleware.py (+45, -12)
A  tests/test_auth.py (+156, -0)
M  config/auth.yml (+5, -0)

## Authentication Implementation

Spent today implementing the JWT authentication system for the platform. 
The main challenge was figuring out the right caching strategy - turns out 
the existing system already has Redis set up for sessions, so I leveraged 
that infrastructure.

### Key Insight

Token revocation needs TWO steps (database + cache) because of the 5-minute 
cache TTL. This wasn't documented anywhere and took some debugging to discover. 
Found this when testing logout functionality - tokens were still valid for up 
to 5 minutes after "revocation" in the database.

### Implementation Highlights

Created `jwt_handler.py` for token management (generation, validation, refresh). 
Integrated it with the existing middleware system. The middleware now checks 
Redis first (fast path), falls back to database if cache miss (slow path), 
and repopulates cache on miss.

Tests cover:
- Happy path authentication
- Token expiration scenarios
- Revocation edge cases (DB only vs DB+cache)
- Concurrent requests with same token

### Performance Notes

Initial implementation had N+1 query problem in token validation. Fixed by 
adding batch token validation for API endpoints that process multiple tokens 
(like bulk operations).

Redis caching reduced average auth check from ~50ms to ~2ms (25x improvement). 
Cache hit rate is ~95% in testing.

### Next Session

Need to add refresh token rotation (security best practice). Also want to 
performance test the caching layer under realistic load patterns. Current 
tests are synthetic.

- Tests: `tests/test_auth.py`

## Implications Section

Every work summary should identify implications:
- What patterns were established?
- What dependencies were added?
- What assumptions were made?
- What needs follow-up?

These will be captured in the decision log automatically.

## Safety Checks

- Preview format before writing
- Confirm file location and policy
- For commit format: Remind user to review before `git commit -F`
- Show byte count and line count after write
- Validate git is available before attempting git commands

## Error Handling

- **Git not available**: "Git not detected. Specify files manually or skip file change detection? [specify/skip]"
- **No work found**: "No work activities detected in conversation. Summary would be empty. Proceed anyway? [y/n]"
- **File write error**: "Cannot write to {path}: {error}. Try different location? [y/n]"

## Decision Logging

After successful execution, this agent **automatically logs** to `major_decisions.json` via the PostToolUse hook:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-10-28T15:30:45Z",
  "session_id": "{from_claude_code}",
  "category": "work_summary",
  "decision": "Documented authentication implementation work",
  "context": {
    "format": "worklog",
    "output": "WORKLOG.md",
    "work_completed": [
      "Implemented JWT authentication",
      "Added Redis caching layer",
      "Created comprehensive test suite"
    ],
    "decisions_made": [
      "Chose PyJWT over custom implementation",
      "Set token TTL to 24 hours",
      "Cache tokens in Redis (5min TTL)"
    ],
    "files_changed": [
      "src/auth/jwt_handler.py",
      "src/auth/middleware.py",
      "tests/test_auth.py",
      "config/auth.yml"
    ]
  },
  "implications": [
    "Authentication pattern established for project",
    "Redis dependency added to infrastructure",
    "Token revocation requires DB + cache updates",
    "Performance significantly improved with caching"
  ]
}
```

This happens **automatically** - you don't need to call anything. Just complete your work summary successfully and the hook handles the rest.

**NOTE**: This agent LOGS TO major_decisions.json. Work summaries are significant because they document project progress and architectural decisions.
