# Session Discovery Logger

## Invocation Context

You receive the conversation context automatically. Your job is to identify and document **genuine discoveries** - things that were surprising, unexpected, or would save future developers time.

## Input Detection

Extract from prompt:
- **Output Path**: Where to write discoveries (detect if missing)
- **Session Summary**: Brief description (optional)
- **Append/Overwrite**: Output policy (default: append if exists, create if new)

## Decision Tree

### If output path provided:
1. Check if file exists
2. If exists: "File exists. Append new discoveries? [y/n]"
3. If new: "Create new discovery log at {path}? [y/n]"
4. On approval → Execute

### If no output path:
1. Suggest: `docs/discoveries/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
2. Ask: "Write discoveries to {suggested_path}? [y/n or provide alternative]"
3. On approval → Execute

## Discovery Detection

**Parse conversation for these patterns:**
- "Discovered that...", "Found out...", "Turns out..."
- "Unexpectedly, ...", "Surprisingly..."
- "The actual behavior is...", "This actually works by..."
- Corrected assumptions
- Hidden dependencies mentioned
- Gotchas or edge cases uncovered
- Performance characteristics not documented
- Security implications discovered

**What qualifies as a discovery:**
✅ Undocumented behaviors
✅ Hidden dependencies
✅ Corrected wrong assumptions
✅ Architecture insights not in docs
✅ Gotchas that caused issues
✅ Security/performance constraints found
✅ Non-obvious patterns or conventions
✅ Surprising interactions between components

**What does NOT qualify:**
❌ Implementation choices (those go in code/commits)
❌ Code style preferences
❌ Minor bug fixes
❌ Routine refactoring
❌ Expected behaviors that match documentation

## Execution Process

1. **Scan conversation** for discovery patterns
2. **Extract discoveries** with full context
3. **Show preview**: 
   ```
   Found {N} discoveries:
   1. {brief title}
   2. {brief title}
   ...
   
   Include all? [y/n or specify which: 1,3,4]
   ```
4. On approval → Write/Append

## Output Format

```markdown
# Discoveries - YYYY-MM-DD

## Discovery: {Title}

**What was found**: The authentication middleware caches tokens in Redis with 
a 5-minute TTL. This wasn't documented anywhere in the codebase and affects 
how token revocation works.

**Why it matters**: Security-critical token invalidation has up to 5-minute 
delay due to the cache TTL. For immediate revocation (e.g., compromised accounts), 
we need to explicitly delete the Redis cache key, not just mark the token as 
revoked in the database.

**Future implications**: When implementing logout or token revocation features:
1. Delete token from database
2. Delete `session:{user_id}` key from Redis
3. Both steps are required for immediate effect
4. Consider adding a "force logout" admin feature that clears Redis

## Discovery: {Another Title}

**What was found**: The RLVR quality system uses a weighted scoring approach 
with 7 categories, but the "collaboration" category only accounts for 5% of 
the total score despite being mentioned frequently in documentation.

**Why it matters**: Teams focusing heavily on collaboration metrics may not 
see significant improvement in overall RLVR scores. The weight distribution 
prioritizes task completion (20%) and user satisfaction (25%).

**Future implications**: 
- When optimizing RLVR scores, focus on completion rate and satisfaction first
- Consider rebalancing weights if collaboration becomes more important
- Document the weight rationale for stakeholders

## Discovery: {Third Discovery}

```

## Validation Checks

Before logging a discovery, ask yourself:
1. **Would this surprise someone new to the codebase?**
2. **Did this cause confusion or issues during work?**
3. **Is this different from what documentation implies?**
4. **Would knowing this earlier have saved time/effort?**

If yes to ANY of these, it's worth logging.

## Safety Checks

- Preview discoveries before writing
- Confirm append vs overwrite vs create-new
- Validate discovery quality (not trivial)
- Show file location after write
- Ensure discoveries are actionable

## Error Handling

- **No discoveries found**: "No significant discoveries detected in conversation. Discoveries should be unexpected findings, not routine work."
- **Output path error**: "Cannot write to {path}. Please specify an accessible location."
- **File exists no append**: "File exists. Choose: [a]ppend, [o]verwrite, [n]ew file"
