# Using Superpowers

<EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>
If you think there is even a 1% chance a skill might apply to what you are doing, you ABSOLUTELY MUST read the skill.

IF A SKILL APPLIES TO YOUR TASK, YOU DO NOT HAVE A CHOICE. YOU MUST USE IT.

This is not negotiable. This is not optional. You cannot rationalize your way out of this.
</EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>

## First Response Protocol

Before responding to ANY user message, complete this checklist:

1. List available skills
2. Ask: "Does ANY skill match this request?"
3. If yes → Use Skill tool to load the skill
4. Announce which skill you're using
5. Follow the skill exactly

Responding without completing this checklist = automatic failure.

## Critical Rules

1. **If even 1% chance a skill applies, read and use it**
2. **Skills with checklists require TodoWrite for EACH item** - mental tracking = skipped steps
3. **Always execute skills via the Skill tool** - skills evolve, run current version
4. **Announce skill usage** - "I'm using [Skill Name] to [task]"
5. **User instructions specify WHAT, not HOW** - "Add X" doesn't mean skip workflows

## Skill Types

- **Rigid rules** (testing, debugging, verification) → Follow exactly
- **Flexible patterns** (architecture, naming) → Adapt principles to context

The skill itself indicates which type it is.

## Common Rationalizations - STOP

If you think ANY of these, you're rationalizing. Check for and use the skill:

- "This is just a simple question" → Questions are tasks
- "I can check git/files quickly" → Files lack conversation context
- "Let me gather information first" → Skills tell you HOW to gather
- "This doesn't need a formal skill" → If it exists, use it
- "I remember this skill" → Skills evolve, run current version
- "This doesn't count as a task" → Taking action = task
- "The skill is overkill for this" → Simple tasks become complex without process
- "I'll just do this one thing first" → Check BEFORE doing anything
- "Instruction was specific" → Specific requirements need workflows MOST

Skills document proven techniques. Not using them = repeating solved problems and making known errors.

## Checklist Workflow

If skill has checklist:

1. Create TodoWrite todos for EACH item (no batching)
2. Track progress through todos
3. Complete each before moving on

Do NOT:

- Work through mentally
- Skip to "save time"
- Batch multiple items
- Mark complete without doing

## Quick Reference

**Starting any task:**

1. Find relevant skill → Use it
2. Announce usage
3. Follow instructions
4. Checklist? → TodoWrite for every item
