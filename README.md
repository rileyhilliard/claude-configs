**Fresh install** (no existing config):

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code && git clone https://github.com/rileyhilliard/claude-configs.git ~/.claude
```

**Merge with existing config:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rileyhilliard/claude-configs.git /tmp/claude-configs && mkdir -p ~/.claude && cp -r /tmp/claude-configs/{commands,agents} ~/.claude/ && rm -rf /tmp/claude-configs
```

That's it! Start Claude Code with `claude` and your commands/agents are ready to use.

### Test It Out

```bash
# Start Claude Code in any project
claude

# Try these:
# Type "/" to see all commands
# Type "@" to see all agents
# Run: /explain README.md
```

**First time?** Try this progression: `/test` â†’ `/explain some-file.js` â†’ `/quick-fix` â†’ `/review` â†’ `@technical-architect help me plan X`

ðŸ’¡ **Remember:** Commands are for quick tasks, agents are for deep work. Escalate from commands to agents when needed.

## What's Inside

### Commands vs Agents: What's the Difference?

**Commands** (`/command-name`) are like quick keyboard shortcuts - they're fast, focused actions that get the job done right now. Use them for routine tasks you do all the time.

**Agents** (`@agent-name`) are like calling in a specialist - they're expert AI personas with deep knowledge, sophisticated workflows, and the patience to work through complex problems systematically. Use them when you need expertise and thoroughness.

### Custom Commands (`/command-name`)

Commands invoke Claude with specific tools and constraints for common dev tasks. They're your daily driver shortcuts.

| Command      | What It Does                                                | Usage Example                            |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `/test`      | Runs tests and analyzes failures with detailed debugging    | `/test` or `/test npm run test:unit`     |
| `/explain`   | Breaks down code or concepts with examples and context      | `/explain src/utils/parser.ts`           |

## Usage Examples

### Real-World Scenarios

**Scenario 1: You broke the build and tests are failing**

```bash
# Run tests and get instant analysis
/test

# If failures are complex, bring in the specialist
@bug-hunter The user authentication tests are failing with "TypeError: Cannot read property 'token' of undefined"
```

**Scenario 2: Code review time**

```bash
# Make your changes, then get a review
/review

# Address any feedback, then stage and commit
git add .
/commit
```

**Scenario 3: Performance is terrible**

```bash
# Identify bottlenecks in a specific file
/optimize src/components/DataTable.tsx

# Or let the optimizer analyze everything
@performance-optimizer The dashboard takes 3+ seconds to load, can you find out why?
```

**Scenario 4: Planning a new feature**

```bash
# Get architectural guidance
@technical-architect I need to add real-time notifications to the app. Users should see updates instantly when data changes, and we have 10k concurrent users.

# Once planned, add comprehensive tests
@test-writer Create integration tests for the notification system following our testing patterns
```

**Scenario 5: Legacy code needs love**

```bash
# Explain what this gnarly code does
/explain src/legacy/payment-processor.js

# Then refactor it with expert guidance
@refactor-specialist This payment processor has grown to 800 lines with nested callbacks. Help me clean this up while keeping it working.
```

**Scenario 6: Quick fixes for the win**

```bash
# Auto-fix linting and type errors instantly
/quick-fix

# Or get help understanding a specific piece of code
/explain parseUserSession
```

## Customization & Extension

Want to create your own commands and agents? It's easier than you think!

### Adding Your Own Commands

Commands are perfect for tasks you do repeatedly. Create a new `.md` file in `~/.claude/commands/`:

**Example: `~/.claude/commands/changelog.md`**

```markdown
---
description: Generate a changelog from git commits
argument-hint: "[from-version]"
model: sonnet
allowed-tools: Bash, Read
---

Generate a changelog from git commits since the specified version (or last tag if not provided).

Process:

1. If $ARGUMENTS is provided, use it as the starting point
2. Otherwise, find the most recent git tag
3. Get all commits since that point with `git log`
4. Organize commits by type (feat, fix, docs, etc.)
5. Format as a markdown changelog

Output should be ready to paste into CHANGELOG.md.
```

**Usage:** `/changelog v1.2.0`

### Creating Custom Agents

Agents are for complex, multi-step work that requires expertise. Create a new `.md` file in `~/.claude/agents/`:

**Example: `~/.claude/agents/security-auditor.md`**

```markdown
---
name: security-auditor
description: Expert at identifying security vulnerabilities and suggesting fixes
tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash, TodoWrite
model: sonnet
color: purple
---

You are a security expert specializing in web application security.

## Focus Areas

- SQL injection and NoSQL injection
- XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) vulnerabilities
- CSRF protection
- Authentication and authorization flaws
- Insecure dependencies
- Sensitive data exposure
- Missing security headers

## Workflow

1. **Scan codebase** for common vulnerability patterns
2. **Analyze** authentication/authorization logic
3. **Check** dependencies for known vulnerabilities
4. **Review** API endpoints for proper validation
5. **Document findings** with severity ratings
6. **Suggest fixes** with code examples

Always explain the risk and impact of each vulnerability found.
```

**Usage:** `@security-auditor Review the authentication system for vulnerabilities`

## Tips & Tricks

### Combining Commands and Agents

Start with a command for quick analysis, then bring in an agent if you need deep expertise:

```bash
# Quick test run
/test

# If failures are complex, escalate to the specialist
@bug-hunter The payment integration tests are failing intermittently. I suspect a race condition.
```

### Chaining Workflows

Commands and agents work great in sequence:

```bash
# Development workflow
/refactor src/utils/validator.js
/test
/review
/commit

# Investigation workflow
/explain src/core/auth-middleware.ts
@security-auditor Check this authentication middleware for vulnerabilities
@test-writer Add comprehensive security tests for the auth middleware
```

### Pro Tips

**Commands accept arguments:** Most commands are smart about optional arguments.

```bash
/test pytest tests/unit          # Run specific test command
/explain AuthController          # Explain a concept or function
/optimize                        # Analyzes unstaged changes if no arg provided
/refactor src/legacy/           # Refactor a whole directory
```

**Agents understand context:** Give agents rich context for better results.

```bash
# Basic (works, but vague)
@bug-hunter fix the login bug

# Better (specific and contextual)
@bug-hunter The login flow returns 401 for valid credentials, but only in production. Local dev works fine. Started after we deployed the session refactor yesterday.
```

**Use git for scoping:** Many commands automatically work with git changes.

```bash
# These commands default to analyzing unstaged changes
/optimize      # Finds performance issues in your current work
/refactor      # Suggests improvements to uncommitted code
/review        # Reviews your uncommitted changes
```

**Check IDE diagnostics:** The `/quick-fix` command is magic for cleanup.

```bash
# Before committing, auto-fix common issues
/quick-fix

# It handles:
# - Import organization
# - Missing semicolons
# - Unused variables
# - Type errors
# - Formatting issues
```

## Agent Personality Guide

Each agent has a distinct approach to their domain. Understanding their "personality" helps you work with them more effectively.

**@bug-hunter** - The Detective

- Methodical and systematic
- Forms testable hypotheses before making changes

- _Use when:_ You need docs people will actually read

**@performance-optimizer** - The Pragmatist

- Measures first, optimizes second
- Asks "Is the complexity worth it?"
- Loves simplifying refactors that also improve speed
- Won't optimize just to optimize
- _Use when:_ You have real performance problems

**@refactor-specialist** - The Restructurer

## FAQ

**Q: Do I need to use agents for everything?**
A: Nope! Commands are great for 90% of daily tasks. Only bring in agents when you need specialized expertise or complex multi-step work.

**Q: Can I modify the existing commands and agents?**
A: Absolutely! They're just markdown files. Edit them to match your workflow, add new tools, change the instructions - make them yours.

**Q: Which model should I use: Sonnet, Opus, or Haiku?**
A: Sonnet is the sweet spot for most tasks (fast + smart). Use Opus for complex reasoning or planning. Use Haiku when speed matters more than sophistication.

**Q: Can agents call other agents?**
A: Yes! Agents can use the `Task` tool to invoke other agents. Some commands (like `/debug`, `/optimize`, `/refactor`) are actually agent launchers.

**Q: How do I see available commands and agents?**
A: In Claude Code, type `/` to see commands or `@` to see agents. Both show autocomplete with descriptions.

**Q: Can I use this config in VS Code or Cursor?**
A: These are specifically for Claude Code (the CLI). VS Code and Cursor have their own extension systems. However, you could adapt the agent prompts for use in those tools.
